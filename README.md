# Hotel-booking-demand-analysis
In this project, I am working with the "Hotel Booking Demand" dataset, which provides information about hotel bookings, including various attributes such as booking dates, guest demographics, and booking outcomes. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and was originally contributed by Jesse Mostipak.

The primary goal of this project is to perform data analysis and exploration on the dataset. This includes tasks such as understanding the dataset, visualizing trends and patterns, and answering questions about the data.

As for the tools and techniques used in this project, I am leveraging Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These libraries allow me to manipulate and analyze the dataset efficiently, create meaningful visualizations, and gain insights from the data.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and visualization while exploring interesting insights from the "Hotel Booking Demand" dataset.
